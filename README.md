# Terraform Module for Webserver

Part of the Week 6 SE Onboarding Terraform exercise

This is based on the Webserver module from the Week 5 exercise:
https://github.com/hashi-strawb/se-onboarding-terraform-oss/tree/main/terraform/03_multiregion/webserver

To avoid external dependencies, this uses a base Ubuntu image from the marketplace, then customises it
